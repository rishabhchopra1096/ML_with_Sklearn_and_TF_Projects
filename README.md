# Machine Learning Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow   

These are the projects I did while working with the awesome book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291) by Aurélien Géron. Each notebook contains notes, external resources and the projects completed for diferrent machine learning algorithms.
